# Sticky Notes FX
There are online versions of software available where they provide **synchronization** of documents between different platforms. This application provides the same approach by taking user details in the beginning and keeping the user's notes synchronized in all platforms such as Desktop and Android.

## Features Implemented
1. The user can access every note separately while keeping the integrity of the notes safe. Currently, the data is consistent during the run-time.
2. When the user deletes the note, it is deleted from the application as well.
3. The user can create a new note from the editable notes as well, and from the note list as well.
4. If the user double-clicks on the note card, it opens up as a separate note.

# Features Being Worked On

1. Currently, synchronizing the data in the local database and keeping only the login information in the *firebase network*.

2. Enable the search option in the note list (filter the notes and show only which contains the searched word).
>***Initial Apporach :** List generated from the search is the subset of the mainList, and since they are having reference to same objects in the memory, updating one should reflect on the major one. Besides this, the application should also keep track of the notes which are opened from the search criteria.*

# Future Work

Since the data is stored in firebase, the application can be made to work on the android platform as well, to provide a better User Experience
> Get hands-on experience on the **Android Development**.
