# Working On Features

1. Currently, syncronize the data in the local database and keep only the login information in the *firebase network*.

2. Enable the search option in the note list (filter the notes and show only which contains the searched word.
>***Initial Apporach :** List generated from the seach is the subset of the mainList, and since they are having reference to same objects in the memory, updating one should reflect on the major one. Besides this, the application should also keep track of the note which are opened from the search criteria.*

# Future Work

Since the data is stored in firebase, the application is supposed to work on the android platform as well, to provide better User Experience
> Get hands-on experience on the **Android Development**.
